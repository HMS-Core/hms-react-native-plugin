## Introduction

The React Native DTM Plugin enables communication between Huawei DTM SDK and React Native platform. 
It exposes all functionality provided bt Huawei DTM SDK.

HUAWEI Dynamic Tag Manager (DTM) is a dynamic tag management system. With DTM, it allows you to dynamically update its tags in a web-based user interface to track specific events and report them to third-party analytics platforms, as well as tracking types of marketing activities.

## Installation Guide

Before using Reactive-Native DTM Plugin code, ensure that the RN development environment has been installed and completed. Also you need to have Huawei developer account to use Huawei Mobile Services and thus the HMS DTM Plugin. You can sign in/register to Huawei developer website from [here](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/console).

### Creating a Project in AppGallery Connect
Creating an app in AppGallery Connect is required in order to communicate with the Huawei services. To create an app, perform the following steps:

**Step 1:** Sign in to [AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/josp/agc/index.html)  and select **My projects**.

**Step 2:** Select your project from the project list or create a new one by clicking the **Add Project** button.

You can also set a default value for a user property on the DTM portal. The default value will be used for the user property if no value is obtained during tag execution. If no default value is set, the user property will be left empty when no value is obtained. |
| Event parameter   | Event parameter, which is generally used to obtain the parameter value of the reported event from the event context during tag execution. |
| Mapping table     | A mapping table contains a group of key-value pairs. You can enter a value and obtain the corresponding parameter value from the table. With the mapping table, you can make the variable value automatically change according to the input value. The following table is a mapping table example. In the example, multiple versions of an app have been released, and the version codes are 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 respectively. If the defined variable Version ID needs to be set to different values for different app versions, you can define the value mapping for each version in a mapping table. During tag execution, the version code is matched to obtain the variable value. |
| Constant          | You can set a constant value for a variable of this type.    |
| Function call     | To obtain the value of a custom variable, you can set the variable type to Function Call and specify the path of a class which has implemented the ICustomVariable API. During tag execution, the variable will be set to the value returned by the specified class. When configuring a Function call variable on the DTM portal, you can configure parameter values which can be used in the class of implemented APIs. |
| Branch            | Branch variables support the following data types: integer, float, Boolean, character, array, and key-value pair. When using the Branch extension template, you can reference relevant Branch variables based on the value ranges of Branch extension template fields. |

import React from 'react';
import HmsDTMModule from '@hmscore/react-native-hms-dtm/src';

 async exampleCustomFunc() {
    try {
      var eventId = "Purchase"
      const params=[
        {
          hasCustom:true,
          value:"price",
          key:"40"

import java.util.Map;

public class CustomVariable implements ICustomVariable {

    @Override
    public String getValue(Map<String, Object> map) {
       String returnValue="";

        for (String key :  map.keySet()) {
            Object value = map.get(key);
            if (value instanceof String ) {
                returnValue = (String) value;
            }
        }
        return returnValue;
    }
}
```

**Step 9.**  Check your EventNames on **App Debugging**


#### Condition
- A condition is the prerequisite for triggering a tag and determines when the tag is executed. A tag must contain at least one trigger condition.
- A condition consists of three elements: name, type, and trigger condition.
- The name and type are mandatory.
- If Trigger is set to All events, all types of events will trigger the condition. If Trigger is set to Some events, you need to further specify trigger conditions for the condition.

- Each trigger condition consists of three parts: variable, operator, and attribute value. You can currently choose between 2 types of conditions and 16 types of operators.
- Currently, condition management includes creating, copying, and deleting a condition.
- Creating a condition: You can create a condition for triggering a tag.
- Copying a condition: You can copy any condition you have created. You can then quickly modify it and add a new condition.
- Deleting a condition: You can delete a condition that is not being referenced.

#### Tag
A tag is used in your app to track events. DTM supports the **HUAWEI Analytics** and custom function templates, as well as many third-party tag extension templates. With DTM, you do not need to add additional third-party tracking tags in your app. You can set parameters and trigger conditions for a tag in DTM, and release the configuration version to track events. You can also update and release tags for your app in DTM after you have released it, so you can adjust tag configurations in real time.

### Download Link
To integrate the plugin, follow the steps below:

**Step 1.**  Download the React Native Analytics Plugin and place **react-native-hms-dtm** under **node_modules/hmscore** of your React Native project, as shown in the directory tree below.

    demo-app
      |_ node_modules
           |_ @hmscore
                |_ react-native-hms-dtm
    ...


**Step 2.**  Open the build.gradle file in the android directory of your React Native project, and change the value of **minSdkVersion** in buildscript to **19**.

```java 
defaultConfig {               
  applicationId "<package_name>"            
  minSdkVersion 19            
  /*                  
  * <Other configurations>                  
  */         
}
```

>Note:  *The **applicationId** must match with the **package_name** entry in the **agconnect-services.json** file.*

**Step 3.**  Configure the signature in android according to the signature file information.
```java 
android {    
    /*     
    * <Other configurations>     
    */    
    signingConfigs {       
        release {            
            storeFile file('<keystore_file>')            
            storePassword '<keystore_password>'            
            keyAlias '<key_alias>'            
            keyPassword '<key_password>'        
        }    
    }   

    buildTypes {        
        debug {            
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release        
        }       
        release {            
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release        
        }    
    }
}
```

**Step 4.**  Replace <keystore_file>, <keystore_password>, <key_alias>, and <key_password> fields with matching entries in your signature file.For further details, please refer to Configuring the Maven Repository Address for the HMS Core SDK.

**Step 5.**  Add the following lines to the android/settings.gradle file in your project:

```java 
rootProject.name = 'RNHmsDTM Demo'
apply from: file("../node_modules/@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/native_modules.gradle"); applyNativeModulesSettingsGradle(settings)
include ':react-native-hms-dtm'
project(':react-native-hms-dtm').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@hmscore/react-native-hms-dtm/android')
include ':app'
```

**Step 6.**  Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in **android/app/build.gradle**:

```java 
dependencies {    
    implementation project(":react-native-hms-dtm")    
    ...   
    implementation 'com.huawei.agconnect:agconnect-core:1.4.1.300'

```

**Step 7.**  Synchronize the project.
Click **Sync Now** and wait until synchronization is complete.

**Step 8.**  Open the **project-dir** > **android** > **app** > **src** > **main** > **java** > <package_name> > **MainApplication.java** file.

Import the following classes to the MainApplication.java file of your project.import **com.huawei.hms.rn.HmsDtmPackage**. 

Then, add the **HmsDtmPackage** to your **getPackages** method.
In the end, your file will be similar to the following:

```java 
package com.huawei.hms.rn.dtm.demo;
...
import com.huawei.hms.rn.dtm.HmsDtmPackage;

public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {

private final ReactNativeHost mReactNativeHost =
    new ReactNativeHost(this) {
        ...
        @Override
        protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
        List<ReactPackage> packages = new PackageList(this).getPackages();
        packages.add(new HmsDtmPackage());
        return packages;
        }
        ...
    };
}
```
