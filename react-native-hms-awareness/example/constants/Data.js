For example, a notification is triggered when an audio device connects to a mobile phone for an audio device status barrier about connection or illuminance is less than 100 lux for an ambient light barrier whose trigger condition is set for illuminance that is less than 100 lux. You can also combine different types of barriers for your app to support different use cases. For example, your app can recommend nearby services if the user has stayed in a specified business zone (geofence) for the preset period of time (time barrier).After your app registers with a barrier, your app can be automatically started when the barrier is triggered. This is because the barrier function of Awareness Kit can run in the background. Your app can then recommend services based on the user's current situation.";
